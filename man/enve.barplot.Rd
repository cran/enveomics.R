\description{Creates nice barplots from tab-delimited tables}
\usage{enve.barplot(x, sizes, top = 25, colors.per.group = 9, bars.width = 4, 
    legend.ncol = 1, other.col = "#000000", add.trend = FALSE, 
    organic.trend = FALSE, sort.by = median, min.report = 101, 
    order = NULL, col, ...)}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{Can be either the input data or the path to the file containing the
table. If it contains the data, it must be a data frame or an object
coercible to data frame. If it is a path, it must point to a
tab-delimited file containing header (first row) and row names (first
column).}
  \item{sizes}{A numeric vector containing the real size of the samples (columns) in
the same order of the input table. If set, the values are assumed to be
100\%, otherwise the sum of the columns is used.}
  \item{top}{Maximum number of categories to display. Any additional categories will
be listed as "Others".}
  \item{colors.per.group}{Number of categories in the first two saturation groups of colors. The
third group contains the remaining categories if needed.}
  \item{bars.width}{Width of the barplot with respect to the legend.}
  \item{legend.ncol}{Number of columns in the legend.}
  \item{other.col}{Color of the "Others" category.}
  \item{add.trend}{Controls if semi-transparent areas are to be plotted between the bars to
connect the regions (trend regions).}
  \item{organic.trend}{Controls if the trend regions are to be smoothed (curves). By default,
trend regions have straight edges. If TRUE, forces add.trend=TRUE.}
  \item{sort.by}{Any function that takes a numeric vector and returns a numeric scalar.
This function is applied to each row, and the resulting values are used
to sort the rows (decreasingly). Good options include: sd, min, max,
mean, median.}
  \item{min.report}{Minimum percentage to report the value in the plot. Any value above 100
indicates that no values are to be reported.}
  \item{order}{Controls how the rows should be ordered. If NULL (default), sort.by is
applied per row and the results are sorted decreasingly. If NA, no
sorting is performed, i.e., the original order is respected. If a vector
is provided, it is assumed to be the custom order to be used (either by
numeric index or by row names).}
  \item{col}{Colors to use. If provided, overrides the variables `top` and
`colors.per.group`, but `other.col` is still used if the vector is
insufficient for all the rows. An additional palette is available with
col='coto' (contributed by Luis (Coto) Orellana).}
  \item{\dots}{Any additional parameters to be passed to `barplot`.}

# Load data
data("phyla.counts", package="enveomics.R", envir=environment())
# Create a barplot sorted by variance with organic trends

  sizes=c(250,100,75,200), # Total sizes of the datasets of each site
  bars.width=2, # Decrease from default, so the names are fully displayed
  organic.trend=TRUE, # Nice curvy background
